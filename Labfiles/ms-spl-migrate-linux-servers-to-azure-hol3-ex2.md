    ![Screenshot of the 'Azure Migrate: Server Migration' overview blade showing the replication state as 'Healthy' for 3 servers.](Images/Replication4.png "Replication summary")

12. Select **Replication (1)** under **Migration** on the left. Select **Refresh (2)** occasionally and wait until the RedHat machine has a **Protected (3)** status, which shows the initial replication is complete. This will take 10-15 minutes.

    ![Screenshot of the 'Azure Migrate: Server Migration - Replicating machines' blade showing the replication status as 'Protected' for all 3 servers.](Images/19-04-2024(1).png "Replication status")

#### Task summary 

In this task, you enabled replication from the Hyper-V host to Azure Migrate and configured the replicated VM size in Azure.

### Task 4: Configure Networking

In this task, you will modify the settings for each replicated VM to use a static private IP address that matches the on-premises IP addresses for that machine.

1. Still using the **Migration and modernization - Replication** blade, select the **redhat** virtual machine. This opens a detailed migration and replication blade for this machine. Take a moment to study this information.

    ![Screenshot from the 'Azure Migrate: Server Migration - Replicating machines' blade with the smarthotelweb1 machine highlighted.](Images/19-04-2024(2).png "Replicating machines")

2. Select **Compute and Network (1)** under **General** on the left, then select **Edit (2)**.

    ![Screenshot of the smarthotelweb1 blade with the 'Compute and Network' and 'Edit' links highlighted.](Images/upd-editcnfredhat.png "Edit Compute and Network settings")

3. Confirm that the VM is configured to use the **F2s_v2** VM size.

4. Under **Network Interfaces**, select **AzureMigrateSwitch** to open the network interface settings.

    ![Screenshot showing the link to edit the network interface settings for a replicated VM.](Images/HOL2-EX3-T3-S5.png "Network Interface settings link")

5. Change the **Private IP address** to **192.168.0.19**

    ![Screenshot showing a private IP address being configured for a replicated VM in ASR.](Images/upd-smarupdateprivate.png "Network interface - static private IP address")

6. Select **OK** to close the network interface settings blade, then **Save** the **redhat** settings to configure the private IP address for the VM.

#### Task summary 

In this task, you modified the settings for each replicated VM to use a static private IP address that matches the on-premises IP addresses for that machine

> **Note**: Azure Migrate makes a "best guess" at the VM settings, but you have full control over the settings of migrated items. In this case, setting a static private IP address ensures the virtual machine in Azure retains the same IPs they had on-premises, which avoids having to reconfigure the VM during migration (for example, by editing web.config files).

### Task 5: Server migration

In this task, you will perform a migration of the Redhat virtual machine to Azure.

> **Note**: In a real-world scenario, you would perform a test migration before the final migration. To save time, you will skip the test migration in this lab. The test migration process is very similar to the final migration.

1. Return to the **Migration and modernization** overview blade. Under **Step 3: Migrate**, select **Migrate more servers**.

    ![Screenshot of the 'Azure Migrate: Server Migration' overview blade, with the 'Migrate' button highlighted.](Images/19-04-2024(3).png "Replication summary")

1. Select **Azure VM** under **Where do you want to migrate to?** and select **Continue (2)**.

    ![Screenshot of the 'Migrate' blade, with 3 machines selected and the 'Migrate' button highlighted.](Images/19-04-2024(4).png "Migrate - VM selection")

2. On the **Migrate** blade, select **yes (1)** for **Shutdown machines before migration to minimum data loss** and select the **redhat (2)** virtual machine then select **Migrate (3)** to start the migration process.

    ![Screenshot of the 'Migrate' blade, with 3 machines selected and the 'Migrate' button highlighted.](Images/upd-starmigrationredhat.png "Migrate - VM selection")

   > **Note**: You can optionally choose whether the on-premises virtual machine should be automatically shut down before migration to minimize data loss. Either setting will work for this lab.

3. The migration process will start.

    ![Screenshot showing 3 VM migration notifications.](Images/upd-Migration3.png "Migration started notifications")

4. To monitor progress, select **Jobs (1)** under **Manage** on the left and review the status of the redhat **Planned failover (2)** job.

    ![Screenshot showing the **Jobs* link and a jobs list with 3 in-progress 'Planned failover' jobs.](Images/24-04-2024(2).png "Migration jobs")

5. **Wait** until the **Planned failover** jobs show a **Status** of **Successful**. You should not need to refresh your browser. This could take up to 15 minutes.

    ![Screenshot showing the **Jobs* link and a jobs list with all 'Planned failover' jobs successful.](Images/19-04-2024(5).png "Migration status")

#### Task summary 

In this task, you used Azure Migrate to create Azure VM using the settings you have configured, and the data replicated from the Hyper-V machine. This migrated your on-premises VM to Azure.

### Summary

In this lab, you began by reviewing your on-prem Hyper-V Red Hat VM and OSS Database, preparing them for migration using Azure Migrate. You then registered the Hyper-V host with Azure Migrate and deployed the Azure Site Recovery Provider. Following this, you enabled replication of the Red Hat VM to Azure, configured static private IP addresses to match on-premises settings, and completed the migration of the VM to Azure. The lab concluded with verifying the migration and ensuring that all resources were correctly created in the Azure environment.
